*Instructions to Run Recursive Crawler*
- Install Neo4j
- In Neo4j, create a new database
- Update the .env file to match the database 
- Run recursiveCrawler.py (warning: sometimes there are database connection issues and the crawler fails or crawls partially, and thus you may need to run recursiveCrawler.py sevetwo or three times)
- You can find an output example in result.csv and result.png (the PNG file is course not interactive, unlike in Neo4j)
