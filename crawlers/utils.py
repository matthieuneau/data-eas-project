This\nframework, termed physics-guided neural networks (PGNN), leverages the output\nof physics-based model simulations along with observational features in a\nhybrid modeling setup to generate predictions using a neural network\narchitecture. Further, this framework uses physics-based loss functions in the\nlearning objective of neural networks to ensure that the model predictions not\nonly show lower errors on the training set but are also scientifically\nconsistent with the known physics on the unlabeled set. We illustrate the\neffectiveness of PGNN for the problem of lake temperature modeling, where\nphysical relationships between the temperature, density, and depth of water are\nused to design a physics-based loss function. By using scientific knowledge to\nguide the construction and learning of neural networks, we are able to show\nthat the proposed framework ensures better generalizability as well as\nscientific consistency of results.
